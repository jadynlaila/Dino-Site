                    <li>Jenna - "My new Dino loves to play with my little daughter and she's only lost one finger while
                        playing with her which is way less than the dinosaurs I've ordered from other services in the
                        past and I
                        am completely satisfied with my purchase thanks Dino Depot!"</li>

                    <li>Dan - "With the pandemic we're currently in I've been working from home and I needed a new pet
                        to
                        keep me company and ever since I got my new dino from the amazing Dino Depot I've had someone to
                        keep me occupied and I've never been more happy especially ever since my dad left me when I was
                        8 years old."
