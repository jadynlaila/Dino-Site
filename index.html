            <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
            <h4>Dino Depot has been at the top of the dino selling business from the very beginning. First and best in
                our field, we vow to supply our community with only the best dinos available. Despite our great success,
                we have remained a simple family-run business. Each member of our family is devoted to the business, and
                we take pride in what we do as it is like carrying on the legacy of our ancestors.<br> Each dino on-site
                is very important to us and we have over 250 acres of land for them to roam! Our dinos have been bred to
                be top of the line for millenia- the quality is unmatched! </h4>

            <h2><u>Dino Care</u></h2>
            <h4>Taking proper care of your new dino from the very start is absolutely critical to its health and
                well-being. We strongly advise you to do heavy research before making the decision to purchase a dino.
                Not only will your dinosaur's health be at risk, but yours will be as well if you don't feed them
                properly! They will find a food source by all means... <br>Basic care requirements state that you must
                have over 5 acres of land and access to 25 gallons of both food and water daily! Care requirements vary
                greatly between different dinos, so we advise you to check out your local library or credible websites
                and get to studying! It's for your own good! </h4>
